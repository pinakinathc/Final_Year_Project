The following image is after using kMeans (self implemented, as the kMeans algorithm needed to be modified to work on N-dimensions instead of 2 dimensions, which various packages generally implement) on the cloud dust of Kepler after supernova explosion:

This image is then seperated into various clusters giving the following image.
